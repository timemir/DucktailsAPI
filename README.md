# Ducktails CRUD API
This is a simple RESTful API for the Ducktails Universe. 

**Link to project:** Currently WIP.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

A Node.js Server with Express to handle all Requests and Responses.

## Optimizations

- Instead of a fake Database as a Javascript object, one could implement an actual DB for storage.
- Go trough the Ducktails Wiki and add all the information for different API endpoints. A lot of work, but fun. 

## Lessons Learned:

Building out APIs while adhering to the RESTful principles makes it a lot easier to structure all endpoints!
